# Description:

Dr.Calory is an app for fitness enthusiasts and individuals who are looking forward to forgoing a healthy lifestyle or losing weight. Considering different factors such as the level of physical activity of the user, their current weight, and their fitness goal the app will create a unique macro-nutrient split tailored to the needs of the user.

This project was developed and coded using Python 3.10.12. This is a Minimum Viable Product to serve as proof of concept.

# Further improvements

This program is a Minimum Viable Product, only serving as proof of concept. The formula and information gathered may be improved, and a graphic representation or app version of the program could also be developed. The data structure of the program is efficient but hard to scale. We may use a different structure in further versions.
